# Industry Brief Generator Skill

A universal industry brief generator.

Input an industry, target market, focus topics, exclusions, and final use. It first creates 20 sourced candidate topics. After you select 8, it generates the final brief, poster, and channel-ready copy.

## Solves This Pain

The hardest part of a daily industry brief is not formatting. It is finding strong topics without turning soft copy into "industry news."

This skill separates research from publishing:

1. Generate a sourced candidate pool first.
2. Let the user choose the final stories.
3. Only then generate the final brief, poster, and copy.

## Demo

Recommended demo prompts:

- Pet Industry | North America | Social Brief
- Office Supplies | Global | Internal Brief
- Chemicals | Europe and North America | Pricing, Supply, Capacity

## What It Does

- Takes an industry, target market, focus topics, exclusions, and final use case
- Searches current overseas industry news, trade shows, product launches, M&A, policy updates, and trends
- Produces 20 candidate topics before any final output
- Waits for the user to select 8 final items
- Generates internal briefs, customer updates, newsletter copy, social copy, or poster-style summaries
- Includes poster QA rules for text overflow, awkward line breaks, and crowded footer layouts

## Trust-First Rules

The most important feature is restraint.

This skill does not:

- fabricate sources, dates, company actions, or links
- turn social media posts into industry facts
- use generic finance news as filler
- generate final posters before the user selects final items

If public information is insufficient, it stops and asks for better sources, a narrower industry boundary, company names, or permission to include older background material.

## Good For

- market research teams
- international business teams
- content operators
- industry media
- sales and BD teams
- export, distribution, and agency teams
